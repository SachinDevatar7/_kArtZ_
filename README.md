# kArtZ

**About the Project:**

- A scalable E-commerce web application similar to Amazon & Walmart where users can purchase any item.

- This experience is absolutely amazing and it gives me loads of must-have knowledge and confidence to start off my next big project using the latest Technology that is MERN Stack.

- I have also used the latest React Hooks which is an absolute joy. The code will be so much simplified and readable, that I didn't believe it.

- The Node API will follow the MVC Pattern. By doing a lot of research I can say the codebase will be so clean and elegant, you will be absolutely loving it.
